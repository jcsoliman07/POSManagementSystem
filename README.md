## üîê Authentication & Authorization

This project uses **Laravel's built-in authentication** with custom **Authorization Policies** to control access at a granular level.

- **Authentication**: Uses Laravel session-based login system (custom login/register or Laravel Breeze, depending on your setup).
- **Authorization**: Implemented through Laravel **Policies** to ensure role-based actions such as:
  - Only **Super Administrators** can delete products/categories and view logs.
  - Only **Admins** and **Super Admins** can edit products and categories.
  - Only **Users (Staff)** can add orders.
  - All sensitive actions are protected using `Gate` or `Policy` checks (e.g., `$this->authorize('delete', $product)`).

‚û°Ô∏è Policy classes are located in `app/Policies/`, and linked via `AuthServiceProvider`.

- All permission checks are enforced via **Laravel Policies**, ensuring secure and scalable access control.
- Example: A `ProductPolicy.php` file contains logic like:
  ```php
  public function delete(User $user, Product $product)
  {
      return $user->role === 'super_admin';
  }
